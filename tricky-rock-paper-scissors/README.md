# Tricky Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with JavaScript

Welcome to the Tricky Rock-Paper-Scissors game! This is a unique web-based game that puts a twist on the classic game we all know. Test your luck against the computer's choices, but be prepared for some unexpected moves!

## Game Mechanics

- The CPU's choices are influenced by a tricky logic:
  - You might find yourself losing 65% of the time.
  - 10% of the rounds end in a draw.
  - In 25% of the rounds, the CPU plays straightforwardly without any tricks.
- The game keeps track of your wins and the CPU's wins.
- If you win against the CPU 20 times and it's a multiple of 20, the CPU might react with ":D" in a playful manner.
- You can reset the score counter and start over by clicking the "RESET" button.
